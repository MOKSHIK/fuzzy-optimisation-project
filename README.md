# Fuzzy Optimisation in Interpretable Systems

This repository contains all code, data structure, and results for my MSc dissertation project:

**"Optimisation Techniques in Fuzzy Systems: Enhancing Performance Without Sacrificing Interpretability"**

---

## 📌 Project Objectives

This research explores methods to optimise fuzzy systems using modern AI techniques while preserving their interpretability. Specifically, the project investigates:

- 📈 **Gradient-based optimisation** using automatic differentiation (e.g. PyTorch)
- 🧠 **Ensemble learning**: bagging, boosting, stacking
- 🧬 **Evolutionary algorithms**: genetic algorithm, differential evolution
- ⚖️ Evaluation of performance vs. interpretability

## 🧪 Datasets Used

- Iris dataset (UCI)
- Wine dataset (UCI)
- [Optional] Financial Time Series (Kaggle or simulated)

> All datasets are publicly available and do not require ethics approval.
